Car Manufactory
Setup

These commands are a helpful quick start. You may choose to ignore them completely and create your own directory structure. If you choose to use this recommendation, just copy the commands below and paste. It doesn't matter what directory you are currently in.

mkdir -p ~/workspace/exercises/mjd/cars && cd $_
Instructions

Follow the instructions in the comments below.

manufactory.js

/*
  Create a function named Car with one property named `manufactured_date`
  whose value will be Date.Now()
 */

/*
  Create a constructor function named Make with one
  argument that will hold the manufacturer of the Make.

  Set its prototype to the Car function.

  Define a property `manufacturer` and assign the
  manufacturer property to the argument value.
 */



/*
    Create a constructor function named Model with one
       argument that will hold the name of the Model.

    Set its prototype to the Make function.

    Define a property `modelName` and set its value to the argument value.
*/


/*
    Create a new instance of your Model constructor.
*/


/*
    Being an avid car collector, you own three different cars all of
    same model from your favorite manufacturer.

    Create three new instances for each of your three favorite cars.
*/


/*
    Being a rich, avid car collector, you own 2 cars from your second
    favorite manufacturer. You also one 1 car from your third favorite
    manufacturer.
*/
If not live-coding, here is some sample coding to get you started.

function Car () {
  // Create the manufactured date property (see above)
};

/*
  Make is-a Car
 */
function Make (maker) {
  this.manufacturer = maker;
}
// Set the prototype to Car

/*
  Chevrolet is-a Make
 */
function Chevrolet (name) {
  this.modelName = name;
}
Chevrolet.prototype = new Make("GM");

/*
  Camaro is-a Chevrolet
 */
function Camaro () {

}
// Set the prototype to appropriate model you created above and set the model name argument
Camaro.prototype = new Chevrolet("Camaro");
